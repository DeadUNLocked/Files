    <h1>Blue Whales</h1>

    <p>The blue whale is the largest animal ever known to have lived on Earth. These marine mammals can reach lengths of up to 100 feet and weigh as much as 200 tons.</p>

    <p>Despite their massive size, blue whales feed primarily on tiny shrimp-like animals called krill. During feeding season, they can consume up to 4 tons of krill per day.</p>

    <p>Blue whales are found in all the world's oceans, except the Arctic. They usually swim alone or in pairs and migrate long distances between feeding and breeding grounds.</p>

    <p>Blue whales are endangered due to past commercial whaling and ongoing threats such as ship strikes and climate change. Conservation efforts continue to help protect these gentle giants.</p>
